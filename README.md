# Finnish Railway System
This project is based on the final project required in the subject Data Structures and Algorithms 1 at Tampere University. Shortly, it performs relationships between stations, regions and trains, and its goal is to run every single function of the project with less than $O(n^2)$.
**Note:** Final function of the project specified later on may not print correctly some of the test cases, but overall it works fine.
