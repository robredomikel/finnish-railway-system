Initial problem: I couldn't debug my program since there was no option, just the 'release'.

In this process it's explained how to perform in this kind of cases:

1. Check in the projects tab of qt (left corner of the UI) and select the Run part, not the Build part.

2. There, check which is the Debugger directory, and to which working directory is pointing. 
   We need to point to the directory where the project files, classes and objects, and data are.

IMPORTANT: When opening a project from qt, first an initial window will show up showing the options qt offers for
	   running the program, we must choose all of them "run" "release" "debug" "profile" so that the kit we are using
	   gives all these build options while programming.

CONCEPT:

	- KIT: Building configuration (It's normally what we set up before configuring the project), and it appears outside the
	       working directory. We can choose different ones and even create new ones, but we must be clear on how to set them
		initially. (That's why all the process explained in this document.)
